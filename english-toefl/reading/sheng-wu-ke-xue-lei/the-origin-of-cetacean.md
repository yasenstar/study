## Text

\[1\] Smell is the most direct of all the senses. It is thought to be the oldest sense in terms of human evolution, which may explain why smell is hardwired into the brain. The olfactory nerve, which manages the perception of smells, is essentially an extension of the brain. The olfactory nerve provides a direct link from receptors at the top of the nose to the portion of the brain that controls memory, emotion, and behavior.

\[2\] The olfactory system detects certain airborne chemicals that enter the nose and then transmits this chemical information to the limbic system in the brain. The olfactory region at the upper end of each nostril is yellow, moist, and full of fatty substances. The shade of yellow indicates the strength of the sense of smell: the deeper the shade, the keener and more acute it is. Animals have a very strong sense of smell, so their olfactory regions are dark yellow to reddish brown, while those of humans are light yellow.

\[3\] When an odorous substance enters the nose, it binds to olfactory receptor cells, the neurons lining the yellow upper portion of the nasal cavity. Olfactory receptor cells contain microscopic hairs called cilia that extend into the layer of mucus coating the inside of the nose. Odor molecules diffuse into this region and are absorbed by the cilia of the olfactory receptor cells. What this means is that when we hold a rose to our nose and inhale, odor molecules float up into the nasal cavity, where they are absorbed by five million olfactory receptor cells. The receptor cells alert the olfactory nerve, which sends impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb, or smell center. Thus, olfactory information about the rose enters the brain’s limbic system, where, in most of us, it stimulates a feeling of pleasure.

\[4\] The limbic system of the brain integrates memory, emotion, and behavior. The system is composed of a group of related nervous system structures that are the functional center of emotions such as anger, fear,pleasure, and sadness. The components of the limbic system are linked to the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain involved in complex learning,reasoning, and personality. The cerebral cortex makes decisions about the emotional content of these unique human qualities after “consulting” the limbic system and other brain centers in processing and retrieving memories. It may, in turn, use memories to modify behavior.

\[5\] Scent may be the strongest trigger of memory and emotions. When we inhale a scent, receptors in the brain’s limbic center compare the odor entering our nose to odors stored in our memory. Along the way,memories associated with those odors are stimulated. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions. The waxy fragrance of crayons can instantly transport us to our second-grade classroom, or the scent of freshly mown grass can flood us with the joy of summer freedom. What we see and hear may fade quickly in short-term memory, but what we smell is sent directly to long-term memory.

\[6\] Smells can increase alertness and stimulate learning and retention. In one study, children memorized a word list, which was presented both with and without accompanying scents. The children recalled words on the list more easily and with higher accuracy when the list was given with scents than without, showing the link between smell and the ability to retain in formation. In another study, researchers examined how various smells can increase alertness and decrease stress. They found that the scent of lavender could wake up the metabolism and make people more alert. They also found that the smell of spiced apples could reduce blood pressure and avert a panic attack in people under stress.

## Glossary

nostalgic: causing a desire for things, persons, or situations of the past; causing homesickness.

This is a question that has puzzled scientists for ages.

\[d\] Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional,between land mammals and cetaceans.

## 文章大意

本文主要介绍的是能够清晰表现鲸鱼在从陆生哺乳动物到海生哺乳动物过渡时期的化石。1979年，一个小组在巴基斯坦北部地区找到了被证明是最古老的鲸鱼的化石。另一个重大发现发生于1989年的埃及，几块龙王鲸（另一种早期鲸鱼）的骨骼被发现于特提斯海遗留下的沉积物中，现在在撒哈拉沙漠暴露出来。一个更令人激动的发现是在1994年报道的，也来自巴基斯坦，已灭绝的走鲸（“会游泳的走动鲸鱼”）生活在四千九百万年前的特提斯海洋。它生活在Pakicetus之后约三百万年的时期，但是比龙王鲸早九百万年。

## 答案详解

1. B  细节题。根据文章第一段第三句话“the presence of a fluke and blowhole cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals.”可知，气孔（blowhole）不能掩盖它们与陆栖哺乳动物有密切关系这一事实。故答案为B项。
2. A  推断题。根据第一段中间部分“unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds ... it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like”可知，还原海獭（sea otter）的原貌并不困难，但是还原鲸鱼的原貌不容易，故答案为A项。
3. C  词汇题。precious意为“宝贵的，珍贵的”，选项中只有valuable与其同义。故答案为C项。
4. C  细节题。文章第三段详细描述了Pakicetus（巴基鲸）and modern cetaceans（现代鲸鱼）之间的异同。根据第三句话“The skull is cetacean-like but ...”可以推断出，巴基鲸和现代鲸鱼的颅骨（skull shape）相似。故答案为C项。
5. A  文章第三段最后提到了巴基鲸（Pakicetus）的生活习性，而代词it指代的正是本段一直在描述的Pakicetus，故答案为A项。
6. B  词汇题。expose意为“暴露，揭露”。选项中只有B项visible最符合expose的词义，故答案为B项。
7. D  细节题。根据文章第四段倒数第二、三句可知，龙王鲸（Basilosaurus）的后腿（hind leg）脚掌只有3个脚趾头。这样的小脚支撑不了50英尺长的Basilosaurus的陆地生活。故答案为D项。
8. D  推断题。根据文中第四段最后一句对Basilosaurus（龙王鲸）的描述可以得知，龙王鲸完全是一种海生的动物，由此可以推断出它会在海里繁殖。故答案为D项。
9. B  推论题。由于在陆地鲸化石中发现了后腿（hind leg），科学家们从中获得了更多有关陆地鲸的重要和完整的信息。故答案为B项。
10. C  原句提供了四个信息“the structure of the backbone”；“Ambulocetus swam like modern whales”；“the rear portion of its body；a fluke was missing”。C项通过句型转换对原句重新作出了解释，并完整地表达了原句的语义，故答案为C项。
11. D  词汇题。根据构词法，前缀pro-表示“往前”，pulse意为“跳动”，由此可以推测出，propulsion应该有“往前跳动，往前推动”的含义。故D项为正确答案。
12. D  解答本题的关键在于本段的设问句“How was the gap between awalking mammal and a swimming whale bridged?”除了这个设问句，其他句子描述的都是细节状况，而所要求插入的句子不仅可以作为该设问句的答语，同时也是一个主题句，使句与句之间的语义更加连贯。因此，插入D处最为恰当。
13. ABE  本题考查的的是主题句与例证句之间逻辑关系的分析能力。本主题句包含了两个重要信息“fossils”和“origins of cetaceans-whales，porpoises, and dolphin ...”。A项是对第一个主题信息的扩展，近期的化石发现有助于了解陆地哺乳动物和鲸类动物之间的密切联系。B项是对第二个主题信息的补充，Ambulocetus的发现为证明鲸鱼曾经在陆地和海洋中都生活过提供了证据。E项对二个主题信息的进一步说明，被认为是陆地行走的哺乳动物和水生鲸鱼的过渡期形式的化石被找到了。其他选项与主题无关，故答案为ABE。
